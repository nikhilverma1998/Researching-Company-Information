Task - User will enter the name and the domain of the company on a spreadsheet and you need to fetch the following details: 
Company Description
Sector
Industry
Funding (if available)

For this task I am using CrunchBase API to get the information.

Crunchbase is a company that provides information about businesses. Their content includes investment and funding information, individuals in leadership positions, and corporate news.

The data received from crunchbase will also have additional files contained in the 'bulk_export_sample.tar.gz'. here I have only uploaded the files which are necessary to get the required information.
